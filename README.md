Automation Script for E-commerce Web App: Developed a Python script using Selenium, a powerful web automation tool, to interact with an e-commerce web application. The script utilizes Chrome WebDriver to perform various actions on the web app.

Dynamic Input and Click Operation: Implemented dynamic input and click operations, where the script iteratively enters a counter value into an input field and clicks on a link element. This simulates user interaction with the application and is useful for testing or automating repetitive tasks.

Robust Handling and Continuous Loop: Incorporated error handling mechanisms and a continuous loop structure to ensure the script runs smoothly. The script demonstrates proficiency in handling web elements, waits for dynamic content, and includes a loop that can be adjusted for different testing scenarios.
